             <h2>About the site</h2>
            <p>During these hard times, it is important to find ways to connect with others and that is why I have created this website</p>
            <br>
            <p>Me and my family have found a lot of joy in creating/finding different quizzes for each other. Some on subjects we know very well and some we don't. Either way it has sparked joy with everyone</p>
            <br>
            <p>Please enjoy the selection of Quiz that are available for you to complete/share amoung your friends and family.</p>
            <br>
